## **📌 Overview**
This project aims to translate **hand gestures from American Sign Language (ASL) into text** using **deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**. The system processes **hand gesture images** and predicts the corresponding sign language representation, enabling **seamless communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments**.  

By leveraging **VGG-19 and CNN-based architectures**, the model achieves **high accuracy in recognizing sign gestures** through pre-processed image inputs.
